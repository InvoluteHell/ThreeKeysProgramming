= A PowerShell Solution

English | link:/README[简体中文]

PowerShell is the \#33 most used language in Github as of 2022 Q1 according to https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2022/1[GitHut's statistics]. Let's take a look at what this scripting language can do.

== Code

3 alphanumericals chosen: `i`, `e` and `x`.

[source,powershell]
----
$i=$?+$?
$e=$i+$i
$xi=$x=$e+$i
$xe=""+$x+$x
$xx=""+$x+--$e
$x=(""+$?)[$i]
iex "`$ex=""``$x{$xe}"";`$xe=""``$x{$xx}"""
$ii=$e+++$i
$ix=$ii+$i
$ei=$e*$i
$x="``$x{"
iex "`$e=""$x$e$ei}e$x$xi$xe}$x$xi$xe}$x$xi$ex}, $x$ii$ix}$x$xi$ex}$x$ix$i}$x$xi$xe}$x$xi$e}!"""
$e
----

Semicolons are necessary if the code is written in a single line. The two are equivalent.

[source,powershell]
----
$i=$?+$?;$e=$i+$i;$xi=$x=$e+$i;$xe=""+$x+$x;$xx=""+$x+--$e;$x=(""+$?)[$i];iex "`$ex=""``$x{$xe}"";`$xe=""``$x{$xx}""";$ii=$e+++$i;$ix=$ii+$i;$ei=$e*$i;$x="``$x{";iex "`$e=""$x$e$ei}e$x$xi$xe}$x$xi$xe}$x$xi$ex}, $x$ii$ix}$x$xi$ex}$x$ix$i}$x$xi$xe}$x$xi$e}!""";$e
----

=== Environment

*PowerShell 7.2.5*

Please install it manually. Since the code uses the `"`u{x}"` syntax which was added in PowerShell 6.0, it won't work on the one preinstalled on Windows.

The code can be run by either pasting it into the PowerShell console or using `.\x.ps1`.

== Explanation

My first thought was if it is possible to directly add or subtract the ASCII value of chars like in most C-style language. However, this is not possible. The target type must be written when it comes to explicit type conversion. `[char]65` does give us the character `A`, but there are 4 different letters. And if we want to get a number, it's `[int] something`. footnote:[https://community.idera.com/database-tools/powershell/powertips/b/tips/posts/converting-ascii-and-characters[Converting ASCII and Characters - Power Tips - Power Tips - IDERA Community]]. 

=== Selection of the 3 characters

Then I try to find the eval function. First I found the very one `Invoke-Expression`, but that is too long. Most PowerShell commands are long. That's bad for a scripting language. Then I found that the ampersand, `&`, can execute command in a string. But it works on a single _command_, without parameters.footnote:[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50018274/why-does-invoke-operator-and-invoke-expression-produce-different-results-for[Why does invoke operator (&) and Invoke-Expression produce different results for the same input? - Stack Overflow]] Luckily, there is an alias of `Invoke-Expression`: `iex`.

=== The first digit

Since there is no way to turn a single char into another, the only way to get a 4th character is to split a String elsewhere. In PowerShell, a character quoted by either `''` or `"` is always a string, an array of chars. There is no .pop() in Powershell,footnote:[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24754822/powershell-remove-item-0-from-an-array[PowerShell Remove item 0 from an array - Stack Overflow]] so we need to access it by index if we want a specific character.

[source,powershell]
----
$i = $? + $?
----

- $? contains the execution status of the last command. It is `True` initially or when the last command succeeded.footnote:[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_automatic_variables?view=powershell-7.2#section-1[$? - PowerShell Core - About - Automatic Variables]]

- The equivalent of `==` is `-eq` in Powershell; `$i==$i` won't work. 

- `True` is `1` when casted to an integer.footnote:[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/lang-spec/chapter-06?view=powershell-7.2#64-conversion-to-integer[Conversion#Conversion to integer]]

- Most lines of code are aimed at getting the digits needed. There is still much room for optimization.

=== Composing Unicode characters

[source,powershell]
----
$x = ("" + $?)[$i]
----

- An empty string plus a boolean turns into a string.

Thanks to the `u` in `"True"`, we can compose any Unicode character now. The hex for hello world string contains `c` and `f`. Just get the two first. The `$e` variable is actually: 

[source,powershell]
----
$e = "``u{48}e``u{6c}``u{6c}``u{6f}, ``u{57}``u{6f}``u{72}``u{6c}``u{64}!";
----

==== Escaping

[source,powershell]
----
iex "`$ex=""``$x{$xe}"";`$xe=""``$x{$xx}"""
----

- To escape ```, `$`, `"`, just add ``` in front of them or repeat the character itself.footnote:[https://www.rlmueller.net/PowerShellEscape.htm[Escaping in PowerShell]]

=== Printing the result

PowerShell prints out the value of the previous expression by default, so there is no need to `iex "echo"` something.

=== Other possible approaches

- The output of a command can be assigned to a variable. Maybe we can find all the needed characters in some commands' default output.

- `$error` stores previous error messages and requires 3 characters.
